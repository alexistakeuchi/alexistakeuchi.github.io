### My Favorite Labs 

* Lab 06 Part 2
  
  Lab 06 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I never played blackjack before. It was interesting to see how we used arguments in the code to make the game. We also used many functions for the game to run. 

* Lab 04 Part 1
  
  Lab 04 Part 1 was one of my favorites because we got to convert measurements of volume from milliliters in the metric system to different units using code. We also got to use multiple variables for different measurements. We used a lot of different measurements as well so it was cool to see what the measurements convert to. 

* Lab 03 Part 1
  
  Lab 03 Part 1 was one of my favorites because we got to practice writing a function definition. We also got to use math in the code to find the area and price of the pizza. To me, this lab was a little difficult as well so getting the input and output to match was satisfying.
